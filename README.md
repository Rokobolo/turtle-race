# Turtle Race Game.
Part of my 19th day of python's course, bet on a turtle and watch if you are the winner.

## What does it do?
- This is an idle game where your only inputs are to chose a winner.
- This program uses the Turtle module.
- Watch the turtles move toward the end of the screen at random pace.

## What is the goal?
- Learning about instances and states of an object.

## How to use?
- When the software starts you will have to choose a turtle to bet on:

- The available colors are part of the following list:
  - color_list = ["red", "blue", "orange", "purple", "pink", "yellow", "green"]
- Once you've selected your turtle, watch the game unfold and see if you are the winner.
